description: Alice Pasmer is the only daughter of parents whose dwindling investments
  have forced their return from Europe to New England. When Alice meets Dan Mavering,
  the easygoing son of a wealthy wallpaper manufacturer, her mother begins a careful
  campaign to bring about their marriage. Mrs. Pasmer's plans, and Dan Mavering's
  hopes, are soon frustrated by Alice, whose character combines high moral scruples
  with easily aroused jealousy.
